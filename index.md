# Welcome to the Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp 2019!

The Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp gives incoming Sociology PhD students a running start at the beginning of their PhD program. The computational and statistical training provides necessary foundation for statistics and methods classes. We understand that participants come into the program with different backgrounds and experiences, and the Summer Methods Camp will be helpful for everyone, regardless of background.

This 2019 Summer Methods Camp will take place Tuesday, September 3rd to Friday, September 6th from 9am to 4pm in 165 Wallace Hall. Katie Donnelly and Olivia Mann are this year's graduate student instructors and Professor Matthew Salganik is faculty advisor.
