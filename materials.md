### Assignments during on-campus portion {#assignmentsduringoncampusportion}

Programming is learned best through practice rather than through passive
listening, so each day we're going to have a short activity/assignment
where you will apply the lessons learned in that morning's programming
lecture. The assignment will be due at **9 AM the following day (right
before next day's programming lecture) on Blackboard** .

For working on the assignment in and out of class, we'll randomly draw
pairs at the end of each programming lecture and your pair will turn in
one copy as a group. You'll have some time at the end of each
programming lecture to work on the activity but may also need to spend
some time on it out of class.

Because the focus will be on these worksheets, there are no required
DataCamp modules-- instead, we'll list the relevant DataCamp modules as
optional references if you want more practice at another time. Likewise,
the listed Gill readings can be used as references but aren't required
before camp.

We'll be available in office hours and on Piazza to offer help on the
assignment.

### Summer DataCamp Exercises {#datacamp}

Here are DataCamp modules that cover topics in using R that we expect
you to be familiar with by the start of camp. Some of you are already
very familiar with R, and as a result, we’re not requiring that the
modules be completed (in contrast, we are requiring completion of the
written assignment). Instead, the modules are there for those new to R
to learn the basics of the language so that they have a foundation that
we’ll spend a lot of time building upon the week of the camp! R and
Rmarkdown each have a learning curve, so as mentioned on the assignment,
we encourage you to setup a time to talk on skype or to use Piazza once
available to get help. If you’re getting stuck on a module, definitely
feel free to just view the solution and take notes to learn from it
rather than getting frustrated/giving up.

1. **All modules in [Introduction to R: Intro to
   Basics](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)**. Be
patient with this one, it starts at a pretty easy pace! It covers Vectors;
Matrices; Factors; Data frames; Lists. Expected time: 4 hours

2. **All modules in [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part
1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1)**.
Complete all modules within ggplot2 (1). It covers intro, data,
aesthetics, geometrics, and qplot. Expected time: 5 hours.
    - Note: R has a built-in plot function called plot. But ggplot2 really
        has much better flexibility and allows you to do much more to visualize
data than basic plotting in R. As a result, we’re going to get you started on
plotting using the package. We’ll discuss it more in detail on our day focused
on plotting/graphics during the methods camp, but the ggplot2 (1) provide a
good baseline. The .rmd file we posted for the assignment also has many
examples where we plot things for you in ggplot2.

3. **All modules in [Reporting with R
   Markdown](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown)**.
We’re sending you the .rmd we used to create the assignment, so if you’re able
to pick up the structure of Rmarkdown well enough from that, there’s no need to
complete this module. But if you’re still confused, this module is helpful
(section 4 on configuring rmarkdown is less useful). Expected time: 3 hours.
    -   Other helpful online resources for Rmarkdown are:
        [Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf);
[Markdown Basics](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html).
    -   Remember that after you’re done, go to Knit pdf to compile the document
        for the pdf to turn in. If you get a knitting error, google it! (and
then post on piazza if you can’t find anything helpful).  Almost everything you
will encounter has been encountered by others.
    -   If you encounter Errors in LaTeX code: this will prevent you from
        knitting – you’ll usually have a line number of the issue.
    -   If you encounter Errors involving package installation: make sure to
        call every package you use using the code: library(packagename). If you
have code installing the package, you need to remove that before you knit so we
recommend using the RStudio console (that box at the bottom) to install any
packages using the code: install.packages(“packagename”).

4. **All modules in [Data Manipulation in R with
dplyr](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/dplyr-data-manipulation-r-tutorial)**.
dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of
verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.
We are going all-in on the [Tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/)! Expected
time: 3 hours.

5. **Advanced Modules**. If the above is review, you can check out:
[Joining Data with
dplyr](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-dplyr);
[ggplot2- Part
2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-2);
[ggplot2- Part
3](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-part-3).

6. **Optional Module [Working with RStudio IDE Part
1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1)**.
For those of you who want a little more introduction on R and RStudio.
This module may help. Expected time: 3 hours.
