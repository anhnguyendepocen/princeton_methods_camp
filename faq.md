## FAQs

* **Should I participate in the camp if I have no plans to do quantitative work
  beyond what's required?** Yes! The aim of the camp is to make all students
feel comfortable approaching the statistics training in the first year of the
program, which in turn, is a crucial foundation for the second year empirical
paper and future work. Both of us are available over email over the summer and
will be holding daily office hours during the camp itself, and we're both happy
to spend extra time working with anyone more nervous about the quantitative
requirements in the program to make sure you feel comfortable about the pace of
the camp and related assignments.

* **Should I participate in the camp if I am highly confident about everything
  math and programming-related?** Yes! Quantitative training means different
things at different places, and the department wants to make sure everyone is
on the same page going into the statistics sequence so that time isn't spent
during the course reviewing foundational concepts. In addition, the camp will
feature lunchtime workshops highlighting qualitative methodology in the
department, which is a good chance to meet professors you may not know already
and get a sense of the range of the department's work.

* **How does this camp fit into the first-year statistics sequence?** The
  purpose of the camp is so that you can hit the ground running in whatever
statistics sequence you opt to take your first year-- both in terms of
foundational math concepts and computing in R.
